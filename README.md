## Project Description
This project is part of the **HNG13 Stage 0 DevOps challenge**.  
It involves deploying and configuring an **NGINX web server** to serve a custom static webpage that is publicly accessible over the internet.

The project demonstrates my ability to:
- Set up and manage a GitHub repository  
- Deploy a live server on a cloud platform  
- Configure and host a web server on **port 80** using **NGINX**  
- Make the webpage accessible through a public IP address

The deployment will be done using **AWS EC2 (Ubuntu Linux)** â€” a virtual server hosted in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud.

**Server IP:** _(To be added after deployment)_
